            <h3>Building Computers</h3>
            <article>
              I started to build computers in early high school (I would say,
              10th grade). It was so exciting for me to make something with my
              own hands, and it performs better than anything you get off the
              shelf. As I got older and got a job, I now had a source of income.
              You can probably guess what I spent that money on. Yup, more computer parts.
              <br>
              <br>
              In the first picture here, that is my current desktop computer. It
              has all the bells and whistles, Watercooling, Overclocking, and the
              latest computer parts. My computers have never been this fancy, I
              started out real small, with a $200 budget, and I have been building
              upon that computer ever since.
              <br>
              <br>
              Through the whole process, I have learned tons about computer hardware,
              how it works, what breaks it, what fixes it, and so much more. From this
              experience, I had even gained enough experience to land a position working
              at Micro Center as a Level II Technician. I think this experience with
              computer hardware helps me as a computer scientist, as I able to
              understand the hardware that I am working with.
              <br>
              <br>
              On this page, I will provide a quick history of the work that I
              have done with building my computer, and how it has evolved.

            <h4>First Computer</h4>
            <article>
              As explained above, my first computer was a really cheap one, and
              was my first real exposure to working on computer hardware. I started
              my build in the spring of my 10th Grade year in high school (2010).
              I had gotten it completed by the time summer came around, so then I
              could play some video games with my friends!
              <br>
              <br>
              I had learned lots of lessons in building my first computer. I had
              learned what was compatible, what wasn't, and how to not light your
              stuff on fire. All learning from experience or guides on the web.
              At this point, I was really proud of it because of the fact that it
              worked. I didn't care too much how high-tier my hardware was, because
              it worked, and it played some video games.

            <h4>Micro Center Era</h4>
            <article>
              After I had graduated high school in 2012, I had gotten a job at the
              Micro Center near Minneapolis. I was hired as a Customer Service
              Rep, and working there had opened up my eyes to all the latest
              computer hardware out there. Since I had built my computer, I had
              been itching to improve it. However, I didn't have any income to
              be able to afford it. Well, now I did.
              <br>
              <br>
              I had decided to buy lots of new parts and upgrade most of the components
              in my computer. In addition to that, I had become interested in
              Watercooling it. Not only because I could overclock it more, but it
              is also a way that I can express my creativity (with the custom
              watercooling at least). By the end of 2013, I had upgraded my computer
              to a new level, and set up the custom watercooling.
              <br>
              <br>
              Among the other employees at Micro Center, I had become the expert on
              custom watercooling. In the process of upgrading, I had learned tons
              in terms of head transfer, water flow, and of course how to put it
              together.

            <h4>Latest Phase</h4>
            <article>
              The latest version of my computer was technically while I was at
              Micro Center, when I was a technician. I had gone to the extreme of
              improving my computer, as I replaced a lot of core components to what
              is considered enthusiast parts. I also increased the complexity of
              the water cooling system that was in there as well.
              <br>
              <br>
              At this point, I had done lots of research to basically develop my
              computer into a powerful piece of artwork. At this point, I had
              modified computer cases and spray painted them different colors along
              with other modifications. I added more parts to the watercooling,
              and I had switched from normal plastic tubing to rigid acrylic tubing.
              <br>
              <br>
              Knowing Me, I will probably continue to improve my computer. I will
              probably keep buying parts and creating an even more customized
              computer to fit my personality.
              <br>

              As I upgrade my computer, I will be updating this page.
