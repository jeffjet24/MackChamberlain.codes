            <h1>Raspberry Pi Work</h1>
            <article>
              Ever since the Raspberry Pi became easily accessible for the public,
              I had been interested and tinkering with them. I have used my
              Raspberry Pi for a wide range of projects. From running a little
              web server, to my latest project, creating a car data logging system.
              <br>
              I think the Raspberry Pi has really peaked my interest because it is
              something that I can work with hands on, and apply my software
              development experience to. Another reason why it had peaked my
              interest (and for many others as well), was because it was cheap
              and affordable for a college student like me.
              <br>
              Alright, enough about why I like Raspberry Pi's, onto my projects!

            <h2>Raspberry Pi Car Data Logger</h2>
            <article>
              Alright, This project is probably my biggest project undertaken
              with a Raspberry Pi, and I am working to develop a data logger for
              my car. The project is still in progress, and is not done yet, so I
              am going to put what I have done so far here.
            </article>

            <h3>Plan</h3>
            <article>
              My idea was to use a Raspberry Pi to read engine data from my car,
              and store it in a time series data format. I could then use my
              experience with R and Shiny to create a web application on a server
              to plot and display that data. This would allow me to see trends in my
              vehicle's temps, transmission, fuel efficiency, speed, and
              overall health.
              <br>
              I decided to use OBD to read those sensors from the engine. When most
              people think of OBD, they think Check Engine Light. That is the most
              common use of OBD, what it was intended to do, diagnose problems.
              However, all cars can also provide some engine sensor data over the OBD
              interface as well. Each car varies in what they can provide of course.
              My hopes are that I can at the very least get the following from my car:
              <ul>
                <li>Engine RPM</li>
                <li>Engine Temp</li>
                <li>Engine Load</li>
                <li>Speed</li>
                <li>Fuel Status</li>
              </ul>
              That's not a lot, is it? I don't think so, but it will give me a good
              amount of insight into how my car is performing if I look at the data
              in the right ways.
            </article>
            <h3>My Hardware</h3>
            <article>
              Thankfully, buying electronics as components are not that expensive, so
              I think I will get by without spending more than $50 on the project.
              So far, this is the list of parts that I have gotten for the project:
              <ul>
                <li>Raspberry Pi (I used a model B rev 2.0)</li>
                <li>16 GB SD Card</li>
                <li>USB Bluetooth 2.1 Adapter (Asus Model USB-BT211)</li>
                <li>USB Wireless N Adapter (Trendnet Model TEW-648UBM)</li>
                <li>FreedomPop Wireless 4G Hotspot</li>
                <li>Bluetooth OBD Car Adapter (
                  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PJPHEBO">Model I Got</a>
                  )
                </li>
                <li>DS3231 RTC Module (
                  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N9VM712">Model I Got</a>
                  )
                </li>
                <li>3A Car Switch (
                  <a href="http://www.mausberrycircuits.com/collections/car-power-supply-switches/products/3a-car-supply-switch">
                    Model I Got</a>
                  )
                </li>
              </ul>
              The reason that I am using an RTC module is because the Pi
              will have an unreliable connection to the internet most of the time.
              Since I am effectively gathering time series data, the time is going to
              be pretty important, and the Pi does not have an internal RTC.
              Installing the RTC module will allow me to have reliable clock data.
              <br>
              The 3A car switch is a contraption that I wire to a few of my car's wires
              so then the switch can power on the Pi when I turn my car on. Also, when
              I turn my car off, the switch stores some extra power in it to allow
              the Pi to shutdown properly after the car has been turned off.
              This is to find a solution to turn the Pi on and off with my car and
              also handle the software safely.
              <br>
              The FreedomPop Wireless hotspot allows my pi to connect to the
              internet and then sync the data with a server at home when my Pi shuts
              down. Not to advertise, but the reason why I am using FreedomPop is
              because I am able to get a free 500MB of wireless data each month. 500MB
              is more than enough to send a text file to a server.
            </article>
            <h3>My Progress</h3>
            <article>
              I am slightly following the setup of a similar project, which can be
              found <a href="https://souvik.me/blog/picard-a-raspberry-pi-based-obd-ii-data-logging-system/">here</a>.
              <br>
              Before I say anything more, if you have any questions about what I did to
              get things working, please send me an email with your questions. I will be
              glad to help you out!
              <br>
              I have gotten the Raspbian distribution loaded onto my Pi and installed the
              python code from the project that I just mentioned. I then proceeded
              to configure the wireless card for the FreedomPop, and got the bluetooth
              drivers installed and got all the needed linux packages installed.
              <br>
              Over the last couple weeks, I have been having difficulty with his code working.
              I initially thought that his code was not designed for my setup. However,
              after quite a bit of investigation, I found that there was additional setup
              needed to communicate over bluetooth with the OBD adapter. So, I finally
              was able to start to get data out of my car!
              <br>
              Next up, I had written startup and shutdown scripts to startup and
              run the scripts automatically, and to shutdown safely. That is how much
              I have completed so far. Things will probably slow down since school
              is coming up soon.
            </article>
            <h3>What's Next</h3>
            <article>
              Now that I have been able to get data out of my car, I am very close
              to completing the car portion(which is the tougher one) of my project.
              So things that need to be done next (in order of importance) is:
              <ul>
                <li>Wire the Car Switch into my Car and test with my Pi</li>
                <li>Start consistently collecting data from my car</li>
                <li>Design the Data Filtering/Analyzing System</li>
                <li>Create the Shiny App and R Code</li>
              </ul>
